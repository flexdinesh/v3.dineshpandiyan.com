I went through all star Open-Source GitHub accounts like <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus\">Sindre Sorhus</a>, browsed through all the tweets and Twitter handles of great developers but was never able to figure out where to get started.</p>\n<p>Then one day I saw this <a href=\"https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules\">git-flight-rules</a> repo featured in GitHub explore of the week newsletter email. The repo seemed pretty new and it was around the same time when I was exploring a lot on how to use git effectively to improve productivity. The repo is a curation of frequently used git commands in the form of documentation. </p>\n<p>It started as <em>'Why not? Let's add what we learned to that repo'</em>.</p>\n<p>I forked the repo and added a few topics on using <code>git stash</code> effectively and created a PR (Pull Request). The repo maintainer accepted the PR and sent a note of thanks for the contribution. The sense of satisfaction I got after that couldn't be put into words. I made a few more commits in the following days, and a few weeks later I became one of the <strong>top 5 contributors</strong> to the repo. The repo now has over <strong>19k stars</strong> and <strong>1k forks</strong> in GitHub.</p>\n<p>So if you want to get started with Open-Source</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't wait for the perfect opportunity. Just pick something from your knowledge base and get started.</li>\n<li>What you contribute to doesn't matter as long as you get a sense of satisfaction in doing it. It doesn't necessarily have to be a ground-breaking ML algorithm, it can be as simple as a curated set of git commands too.</li>\n<li>Follow the GitHub explore of the week newsletter to keep tabs on interesting repos. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since then I have contributed to a few repos and have three npm packages under my belt. I'll be writing about the npm packages in the following posts.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I got started with Open-Source","canonicalURL":"https://dev.to/flexdinesh/how-i-got-started-with-open-source--882","date":"Feb 4, 2018","noPage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-i-got-started-with-open-source/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1381026181","3065158460"]}
