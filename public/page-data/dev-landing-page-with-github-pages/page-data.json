So here, I present you a ready-made <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page\">Developer Landing Page</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Usually creating a personal website would involve buying/registering a domain name, finding a free/paid hosting service, developing your site and uploading it to the hosting provider.</p>\n<p>But with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>, publishing your site is as easy as drinking a coffee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need a GitHub account (you obviously have one already)</li>\n<li>Create a new repo with the name <code>{username}.github.io</code></li>\n<li>Clone the repo and create an <code>index.html</code> file</li>\n<li>Add some content and <code>git push</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Voila! Your site should be live at <code>https://{username}.github.io</code> in seconds.</p>\n<h2>Developer Landing Page</h2>\n<p>I wanted a <strong>Dev Landing Page</strong> to showcase everything I do online. And I wanted it to be <strong>minimal</strong> and right to the point rather than beautiful and hefty. So I sat down one night and created this <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page\">Dev Landing Page</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Few of my friends liked it and I created the same in a few different themes for them.\nAnd I think for most of the devs out there would like to have something similar. So if you're not looking for something fancy and like this minimal <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page\">Dev Landing Page</a></strong>, feel free to fork/clone and customize it to your dev taste.</p>\n<p>You can pick from one of these <strong>9 material themes</strong> or change the colors it to suit your taste 'coz it's just too easy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/jJVKCn/dev_landing_page_themes.jpg\" alt=\"9 Material Themes\"></p>\n<p>Here's my <strong><a href=\"https://flexdinesh.github.io\">Dev Landing Page - Dinesh</a></strong>, shining bright in my favourite yellow! ðŸŽ‰</p>\n<p>You are amazing! Have a great day! âœ¨</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Create your developer landing page with GitHub Pages","canonicalURL":"https://dev.to/flexdinesh/create-your-developer-landing-page-with-github-pages---42jk","date":"Feb 9, 2018","noPage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dev-landing-page-with-github-pages/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1381026181","3065158460"]}
