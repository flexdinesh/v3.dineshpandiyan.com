_**TL;DR** - I built a tool - [tweetfancy.io](https://tweetfancy.io/) to tweet in bold, italics and strikethrough text._

Ever fancied tweeting with **bold**, _italics_ or ~~strikethrough~~ text?

Twitter doesn't allow its users to format tweets. But having an option to _emphasize_ or **call out** a word or a phrase in a tweet might come in handy at times.

# Announcing tweetfancy.io

I recently realized that the UTF charset has [characters and symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols) that look like **bold**, _italics_ or ~~strikethrough~~ ascii characters. So I built a tool that generates these characters which could be copied and pasted into almost any website out there.

- Write your original text in markdown
- The editor will generate text for you to copy/paste
- Tweet directly from the editor
- Copy/Paste the generated text into any website (FB/Insta/etc)

_Note: The generated characters are mathematical symbols and not actual English alphabets. So if you run them by a screen reader, you'll find that the reader reads them out by their symbol name. But then, all screen readers struggle reading smileys too (ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸ¦„ðŸ˜Ž) and that doesn't stop us from using smileys. So,we might use this as well._

Go bonkers tweeting in **bold**, _italics_ or ~~strikethrough~~! Happy tweeting! ðŸŽ‰
