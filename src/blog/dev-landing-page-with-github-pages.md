_All of us devs, at one point or other, would have wanted to have a personal website of our own, either to showcase our online presence or just 'coz it's fun. So here, I present you a ready-made **[Developer Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page)**_

Usually creating a personal website would involve buying/registering a domain name, finding a free/paid hosting service, developing your site and uploading it to the hosting provider.

But with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), publishing your site is as easy as drinking a coffee.

- You need a GitHub account (you obviously have one already)
- Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
- Clone the repo and create an `index.html` file
- Add some content and `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io` in seconds.

## Developer Landing Page

I wanted a **Dev Landing Page** to showcase everything I do online. And I wanted it to be **minimal** and right to the point rather than beautiful and hefty. So I sat down one night and created this **[Dev Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page)**.

Few of my friends liked it and I created the same in a few different themes for them.
And I think for most of the devs out there would like to have something similar. So if you're not looking for something fancy and like this minimal **[Dev Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page)**, feel free to fork/clone and customize it to your dev taste.

You can pick from one of these **9 material themes** or change the colors it to suit your taste 'coz it's just too easy.

Here's my **[Dev Landing Page - Dinesh](https://flexdinesh.github.io)**, shining bright in my favourite yellow! ðŸŽ‰

You are amazing! Have a great day! âœ¨
